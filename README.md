# mani-easy-persian-translator

**Mani** is a lightweight, yet powerful local and online any-language to Persian (and vice versa) translator for Linux, built with Bash. It's designed to be fast, simple, and easy to use directly from your keyboard shortcut.

---

### 🚀 **Installation**

To get started, simply run the following command to install the translator:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omidabedi/mani-easy-persian-translator/refs/heads/main/mani-installer.sh | sh
```

This will download and install the necessary files to your system.

🧑‍💻 How to Use
Once installed, you can set up a keyboard shortcut, such as Ctrl + Shift + M, to trigger the translator. By default, the script is located at ~/mani.sh.

Highlight the text you want to translate.
Press your chosen keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + M).
The translation will appear as a desktop notification.
It's a simple and effective tool, created as a side project to solve a personal need, with some help from Grok.
